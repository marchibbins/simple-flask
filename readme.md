##Simple Flask template server

A simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework for rendering templates with JSON data.

This is basically a refactor of [simple-express](https://github.com/marchibbins/simple-express), which was only made for [a bit of an exercise](http://blog.marchibbins.com/2012/08/21/building/) in Node.js - Python is more my style.
